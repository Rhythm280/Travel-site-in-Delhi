        <p class="para">Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by
            hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact. Paintballs
            are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air or
            carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle. <br> The game was
            invented in June 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an
            outdoorsman and writer.[3] A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to
            survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. The two
            men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle
            their argument with 10 other men all in individual competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball.

        <p class="para">Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, across, or down natural rock formations
            or indoor climbing walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually
            pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that
            often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of
            proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion
            of routes. <br> Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has
            been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, bouldering, sport
            climbing, and trad climbing.Rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in
            the least amount of attempts, the least amount of time, or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly
            difficult route. Indoor rock climbing is typically split into three disciplines: bouldering, lead climbing,
            and top roping.</p><br>
