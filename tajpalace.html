    <p>Located near the Old Fort in Delhi, National Zoological Park is one of the most popular tourist places in Delhi.
      The National Zoological Park which was formerly called Delhi Zoo was later renamed to make it an ideal model of a
      zoo in the country. <br>

      domestic animals. The zoo houses around 1300 animals from around 130 species of Indian as well as international
      animals and birds. The zoo serves as a home for these animals and is also a breeding ground for those animals.
      This natural citadel situated in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Delhi serves as a break for the citizens.
      <br>

      Tiger,Zebras, Indian Rhinoceros, Brow Antlered Deer, Swamp Deer, Giraffes, Gir Lion and migratory birds like

    <p>As weird and intriguing this may sound, the concept is as brilliant and unique. The 1st ever Soap-Football arena
      opened in Delhi. 55 minutes, 2 teams and 1 winner is the super amazing concept of the game that you play with a
      minimum of your 4 friends (maximum 5 per team) along with 2 substitutes. A massive, heavily-cushioned plastic
      floor covered with diluted
      soap water played barefoot sure does break your fall and let you have the time of your life. It doesn't even
      matter if you are athletic or not, you are just there to run, fall a lot and have a blast of your time. The place

    <p>Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them
      with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot
      using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air or carbon dioxide and
      were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle. <br> The game was invented in June 1981 in New
      Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer.[3] A debate
      arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had
      spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun
      in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle their argument with 10 other men all in individual
      competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball.</p>

    <p>Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, across, or down natural rock formations or indoor
      climbing walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route
      without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's
      strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and
      the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. <br> Because of the wide
      range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different
      styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, bouldering, sport climbing, and trad climbing.Rock climbing
      competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the least amount of attempts, the least amount
      of time, or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Indoor rock climbing is typically
      split into three disciplines: bouldering, lead climbing, and top roping.</p>
