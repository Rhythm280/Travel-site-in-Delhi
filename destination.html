            <h2 class="destination_heading">INDIA GATE</h2>
            <p>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Kartavya
                path on the
                eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath. It stands as a memorial to
                74,187 soldiers
                of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
                Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa,
                Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300
                servicemen's names, including some
                soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens,
                the gate evokes the
                architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and
                later memorial arches; it
                is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.<br>

                Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a
                reversed rifle, capped by a
                war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called
                Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the
                Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted
                amongst the largest war
                memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to
                the Amar Jawan Jyoti,
                following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society
                protests, and is popular with
                tourists.<br>

                The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), which came into
                existence in December 1917 under
                the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First World
                War. The foundation stone
                of the gate then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30, by the
                visiting Duke of Connaught in a
                ceremony attended by officers and men of the Imperial Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the
                commander in chief, and Chelmsford,
                the viceroy. On the occasion, the viceroy is reported to have said, "The stirring tales of individual
                heroism, will live forever
                in the annals of this country", and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes,
                "known and unknown", would
                inspire future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and "no less valor". <br>
                The Duke also read out a message by the King, which said, "On this spot, in the central vista of the
                Capital of India, there
                will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep", in the thoughts of future generations, "the glorious
                sacrifice of the officers
                and men of the Indian Army who fought and fell". During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and
                Miners, 6th Jat Light
                Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas,
                and 5th Gurkha Rifles.
                The land was owned by contractor Sir Sobha Singh who helped construct large tracts of New Delhi and was
                the primary contractor.<br></p>

            <h2 class="destination_heading">Red Fort</h2>
            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that
                historically served as the main
                residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May
                1639, when he decided to
                shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect
                Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
                constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in the Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
                combines Persian palace
                architecture with Indian traditions.

                The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in
                1739. Most of the fort's
                marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
                The fort's defensive walls
                were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.

                On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the
                Lahori Gate. Every year
                on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the
                fort's main gate and delivers
                a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public Address System of Indian Army Corps
                of Signals.The Red Fort was
                designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.<br>
                Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift
                his capital from Agra to Delhi.
                Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours, its design is credited to architect Ustad
                Ahmad Lahori, who also
                constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of
                the walls.
                Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it
                was completed
                on 6 April 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain
                the older
                Salimgarh Fort. The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day
                Old Delhi.
                Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private
                quarters, constructing barbicans
                in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous. Image shows Red
                Fort's long walls including
                the gates as seen from Jama Masjid's tower. The walls can be seen in the background extending a couple
                of thousand meters.
                The administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty declined after Aurangzeb, and the 18th
                century saw a degeneration
                of the palace. In 1712 Jahandar Shah became the Mughal Emperor. Within a year of beginning his rule,
                Shah was murdered and replaced
                by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, Persian emperor Nadir Shah easily defeated the strong Mughal army of around
                200,000 soldiers,
                plundering the Red Fort, including the Peacock Throne. Nadir Shah returned to Persia after three months,
                leaving a destroyed
                city and a weakened Mughal empire to Muhammad Shah.</p>

            <h2 class="destination_heading">Qutub Minar</h2>
            <p>The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
                part of the Qutb complex,
                which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It
                consists of 399 steps
                It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It is one of the most
                visited tourist
                spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.

                It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of 1190, which was
                constructed a decade or so
                before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with
                inscriptions and geometric
                patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the
                balconies" at the top of each
                stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque
                where they
                exist. In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving
                international relations. In
                September 2023, the monument was lit up in the colors of the Mexican flag to celebrate Mexico's 213th
                Independence Day, an
                event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico in India. Similarly, on October 30,
                the Qutub Minar
                was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an
                occasion that received
                special attention from the Turkish Embassy in New Delhi.<br>
                The tower includes elements of traditional Islamic architecture and southwestern Asian design. Elizabeth
                Lambourn's Islam
                Beyond Empires: Mosques and Islamic Landscapes in India and the Indian Ocean studies the introduction of
                Islam in South Asia
                and how the region influenced the Islamic religious architecture. These newly arrived Muslims from the
                Islamic West escaped
                the Mongol Empire and emigrated to India, where they constructed religious centers. The Qutb Minar
                serves as a central marker
                to these new Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence in the area. The
                architecture of the
                minaret varies greatly from that of the typical style and design of the mosques constructed in the
                Middle East. The style of
                these structures is influenced by the local architecture such as the Indic temples. This affected the
                different materials,
                techniques, and decoration that were used in the construction of the Qutb Minar. Historically, tower
                minarets were uncommon
                in South Asian-Islamic design until the 17th century, due to the slow adoption of the typical Middle
                Eastern style in India.
                It is also detached from the main mosque, showcasing how the native culture affected the design of a
                Middle Eastern structure.
                The Qutb Minar is seen as the "earliest and best example of a fusion or synthesis of Hindu-Muslim
                traditions" according to Ved Parkash
                in his essay The Qutb Minar from Contemporary and Near Contemporary Sources. Like many mosques built in
                South Asia during this time
                period, the minaret was constructed by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by Muslim architects.
                This led to a construction
                that synthesized both Hindu and Islamic religious architecture. Since some of the craftsmen were Hindu
                and unfamiliar with the Quran,
                the inscriptions are a compilation of disarranged Quranic texts and other Arabic expressions.</p>

            <h2 class="destination_heading">Humayun's Tomb</h2>
            <p>Humayun's tomb (Urdu: ہمائیوں کا مقبرہ) (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of Mughal emperor, Mirza
                Nasir al-Din Muhammad
                commonly known as Humayun situated in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife
                and chief consort,
                Empress Bega Begum under her patronage in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid
                Muhammad,
                Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is
                located in
                Nizamuddin East, Delhi, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that
                Humayun found in 1538. It
                was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site
                in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete. Besides the main
                tomb enclosure of
                Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West,
                including one that
                even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niazi, an
                Afghan noble in Sher Shah
                Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.

                The complex encompasses the main tomb of the Emperor Humayun, which houses the graves of Empress Bega
                Begum, Hajji Begum, and
                also Dara Shikoh, great-great-grandson of Humayun and son of the later Emperor Shah Jahan, as well as
                numerous other subsequent
                Mughals, including Emperor Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi Ul-Darjat, Rafi Ud-Daulat, Muhammad Kam
                Bakhsh and Alamgir II. It
                represented a leap in Mughal architecture, and together with its accomplished Charbagh garden, typical
                of Persian gardens, but
                never seen before in India, it set a precedent for subsequent Mughal architecture. It is seen as a clear
                departure from the
                fairly modest mausoleum of his father, the first Mughal Emperor, Babur, called Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of
                Babur) in Kabul
                (Afghanistan). Though the latter was the first Emperor to start the tradition of being buried in a
                paradise garden. Modelled
                on Gur-e Amir, the tomb of his ancestor and Asia's conqueror Timur in Samarkand, it created a precedent
                for future Mughal
                architecture of royal mausolea, which reached its zenith with the Taj Mahal, at Agra.<br>

                The site was chosen on the banks of Yamuna River, due to its proximity to Nizamuddin Dargah, the
                mausoleum of the celebrated
                Sufi saint of Delhi, Nizamuddin Auliya, who was much revered by the rulers of Delhi, and whose
                residence, Chilla Nizamuddin
                Auliya lies just north-east of the tomb. In later Mughal history, the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah
                Zafar took refuge here,
                during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, along with three princes, and was captured by Captain Hodson before
                being exiled to Rangoon.
                At the time of the Slave Dynasty this land was under the 'KiloKheri Fort' which was capital of Sultan
                Qaiqabad, son of
                Nasiruddin(1268–1287).

                The Tombs of Battashewala Complex lie in the buffer zone of the World Heritage Site of the Humayun Tomb
                Complex; the two
                complexes are separated by a small road but enclosed within their own separate compound wall.</p>

            <h2 class="destination_heading">Lotus Temple</h2>
            <p>The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in
                December 1986.
                Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í
                Houses of Worship,
                the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. The building is
                composed of 27
                free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides, with nine doors
                opening onto a central
                hall with a height of slightly over 34 metres and a capacity of 1,300 people. The Lotus Temple has won
                numerous
                architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.
                The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California,
                after spending some
                years in Canada. He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its
                construction. The structural
                design was undertaken by the British firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months, and the
                construction was done by
                ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited at a cost of $10.56 million. The major part of the
                funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose
                will stipulated that his
                entire life savings would go towards the building of the temple. A portion of the construction budget
                was
                saved and used to build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate
                for use on the site.
                Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977 and dedicated the
                temple on 24 December 1986.
                For the dedication, there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000
                Baháʼís from 22 states
                in India. The temple was opened to the public on 1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that
                day.<br>
                All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of
                which are specified by
                Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote that Baháʼí Houses of
                Worship must be nine-sided
                and circular. While all current Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an
                essential part of their
                architecture. The Baháʼí scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images may be displayed
                within the House of
                Worship, and no pulpits or altars may be incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand
                behind simple portable
                lecture stands). The design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is inspired by the lotus flower and is
                composed of
                27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides. The temple's
                shape has symbolic
                and inter-religious significance because the lotus is often associated with purity, sacredness,
                spirituality, and knowledge.
                It has a spiritual significance in India. The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall
                34.3 metres tall
                that can seat 1,300 people and hold up to 2,500 people. The temple has a diameter of 70 m. The surface
                of the House
                of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the
                construction of many ancient
                monuments and other Baháʼí buildings. Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens,
                the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m2; 10.5 ha). An educational centre beside the
                temple was established
                in 2017.
                The Lotus Temple is situated near the Kalkaji Mandir metro station about 500 metres away. It is in the
                village of Bahapur in
                New Delhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi, near Nehru Place and lies on the western bank of the
                Yamuna River.

                Of the temple's total electricity use of 500 kilowatts (kW), 120 kW is provided by solar power generated
                by solar panels on
                the building. This saves the temple ₹120,000 per month. It is the first temple in Delhi to use solar
                power.</p>
